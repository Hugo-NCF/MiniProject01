# Description
Our MiniProject is a store that sells cleats from three different brands which are clearly seperated.
We decided to give the page a darker background so the green from our logo is clearly visible and readable.
The navbar is fixed and has a profile Icon added, which we all also centered. The Footer is more centered and has the same 
design as the rest of the page. We added the logo here as well and added an all rights reserved to make the page look more professional.
The cards which present our products have an almost transparent background and lifts off the screen to pop up to the customers eye by adding transform which scales the card.
